        BGP-LS Advertisement of Segment Routing Service Segments
              draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-sr-service-segments-02

Abstract

   Service functions are deployed as, physical or virtualized elements
   along with network nodes or on servers in data centers.  Segment
   Routing (SR) brings in the concept of segments which can be
   topological or service instructions.  Service segments are SR
   segments that are associated with service functions.  SR Policies are
   used for the setup of paths for steering of traffic through service
   functions using their service segments.

   BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables distribution of topology information
   from the network to a controller or an application in general so it
   can learn the network topology.  This document specifies the
   extensions to BGP-LS for the advertisement of service functions along
   their associated service segments.  The BGP-LS advertisement of
   service function information along with the network nodes that they
   are attached to, or associated with, enables controllers compute and
   setup service paths in the network.

1.  Introduction

   Segments are introduced in the SR architecture [RFC8402].  Segment
   Routing based Service chaining is well described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-service-programming] with an example of network
   and services.

   This document extend the example to add a Segment Routing Controller
   (SR-C) to the network, for the purpose of service discovery and SR
   policy [RFC9256] instantiation.

   Consider the network represented in Figure 1 below where:

   *  A and B are two end hosts using IPv4.

   *  S1 is an SR-aware firewall Service.

   *  S2 is an SR-unaware DPI Service.

                  SR-C                   --3--
                                        /     \
                                       /       \
                            A----1----2----4----5----6----B
                                      |         |
                                      |         |
                                      S1        S2

                      Figure 1: Network with Services

   SR Controller (SR-C) is connected to the network.

   SR-C can receive BGP-LS updates to discover topology, and calculate
   constrained paths between nodes 1 and 6.

   However, if SR-C is configured to compute a constrained path from 1
   and 6, including a DPI service (i.e., S2) it is not yet possible due
   to the lack of service distribution.  SR-C does not know where a DPI
   service is nor the SID for it.  It does not know that S2 is a service
   it needs.

   This document proposes an extension to BGP-LS for Service Chaining to
   distribute the service information to SR-C.  There may be other
   alternate mechanisms to distribute service information to SR-C and
   are outside the scope of this document.  There are no extensions
   required in SR-TE Policy SAFI.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  BGP-LS Extensions for Service Chaining

   For an attached service, following data needs to be shared with SR-C:

   *  Service SID value (e.g.  MPLS label or IPv6 address).  Service SID
      MAY be encoded as LOC:FUNCT:ARG as specified in [RFC8986].

   *  Function Identifier (Static Proxy, Dynamic Proxy, Shared Memory
      Proxy, Masquerading Proxy, SR Aware Service etc.).

   *  Service Type (DPI, Firewall, Classifier, LB etc.).

   *  Traffic Type (IPv4 OR IPv6 OR Ethernet)

   *  Opaque Data (Such as brand and version, other extra information)

   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-service-programming] defines SR-aware and SR-
   unaware services.  This document will reuse these definitions.  Per
   [RFC7752] Node Attributes are ONLY associated with the Node NLRI.
   All non-VPN information SHALL be encoded using AFI 16388 / SAFI 71.
   VPN information SHALL be encoded using AFI 16388 / SAFI 72 with
   associated RTs.

   This document introduces new TLVs for the SRv6 SID NLRI
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-srv6-ext] and SR-MPLS SID/Label TLV [RFC9085] to
   associate the Service SID value with Service-related Information
   using Service Chaining(SC) Sub-TLV.

   SRv6 SID Information TLV [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-srv6-ext] encodes
   behavior along with associated SID Flags.

   A Service Chaining (SC) TLV in Figure 2 is defined as:

   Service Type(ST) MUST be encoded as part of SC TLV.

   There may be multiple instances of similar Services that need to be
   distinguished.  For example, firewalls made by different vendors A
   and B may need to be identified differently because, while they have
   similar functionality, their behavior is not identical.

   In order for the SDN Controller to identify the categories of
   Services and their associated SIDs, this section defines the BGP-LS
   extensions required to encode these characteristics and other
   relevant information about these Services.

   Another Optional Opaque Metadata(OM) TLV of SRv6 SID NLRI may encode
   vendor specific information.  Multiple of OM TLVs may be encoded.

      length is recorded in length field.

   Opaque Metadata(OM) TLV defined in Figure 3 may encode propriety or
   Service Opaque information such as:

   *  Vendor specific Service Information.

   *  Traffic Limiting Information to particular Service Type.

   *  Opaque Information unique to the Service.

   *  Propriety Enterprise Service specific Information.

3.  Illustration

   In our SRv6 example above Figure 1, Node 5 is configured with an SRv6
   dynamic proxy segments (End.AD) C5::AD:F2 for S2.

   The BGP-LS advertisement MUST include SRv6 SID NLRI with SRv6 SID
   Information TLV in the BGP-LS Attribute:

   *  Service SID: C5::AD:F2 SID

   *  Endpoint Behavior: END.AD

   The BGP-LS Attribute MUST contain a SC TLV with:

   *  Service Type: Deep Packet Inspection(DPI)

   *  Traffic Type: IPv4 Capable.

   The BGP-LS Attribute MAY contain a OM TLV with:

   *  Opaque Type: Cisco DPI Version

   *  Value: 3.5

   In our example in Figure 1, using BGP SR-TE SAFI Update
   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy], SR Controller computes the
   candidate path and pushes the Policy.

   SRv6 encapsulation policy < CF1::, C3::, C5::AD:F2, C6::D4:B > is
   signaled to Node 1 which has mix of service and topological segments.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests assigning code-points from the registry "BGP-
   LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute
   TLVs".

4.1.  Service Type Table

   IANA is request to create a new top-level registry called "Service
   Type Table (STT)".  Valid values are in the range 0 to 65535.  Values
   0 and 65535 are to be marked "Reserved, not to be allocated".
